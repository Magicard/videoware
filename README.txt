All you have to do move the video file you want as a background into the source folder and name it video.mp4. 
Make sure there is only one video.mp4 in the folder.
Also from my testing it is a hit and miss with .mkv files because of the way they are processed so if you are having issues with that just convert it to a MP4 or flv until i have fixed the issue.
Enjoy!
